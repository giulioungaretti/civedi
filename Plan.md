People with moderate–strong astigmatism generally read more comfortably with dark text on a light (but not pure‑white) background. Pure white‑on‑black often causes “halation” and reduced clarity, while slightly off‑white backgrounds with high contrast tend to minimize blur and eye strain.

What the evidence says (from accessibility and vision‑science sources)
1. White text on black (dark mode) is usually worse for astigmatism
Multiple accessibility experts warn that white text on pure black produces a “halation” effect — a glowing, fuzzy halo around letters — which is especially problematic for people with astigmatism.
• 	Level Access (a leading digital accessibility authority) explicitly states that white-on-black creates visual fuzzing and headaches for astigmatic readers.
• 	UX accessibility research also notes that dark backgrounds force the iris to open more, making focusing harder for people with astigmatism.
Conclusion:
If you have strong astigmatism, pure dark mode (white on black) is usually the worst option.

2. Black text on white is better — but pure white can be too harsh
High contrast with dark text on a light background is generally recommended for readability, but pure white can cause glare, which worsens astigmatic blur.
• 	RNIB (Royal National Institute of Blind People) notes that many people with sight loss prefer black text on white or yellow backgrounds, but glare sensitivity varies.
Conclusion:
Black text on a light background is typically better — but you should avoid pure bright white.

3. The best option for strong astigmatism: high contrast, light background, reduced glare
Recommended combinations
• 	Dark grey text (#111–#222) on off‑white background (#F5F5F5, #FAFAF0, light beige, or light yellow)
• 	Dark blue/navy text on pale cream or pale grey
• 	Avoid pure white (#FFFFFF) and pure black (#000000)
These combinations reduce:
• 	Halation
• 	Glare
• 	Iris dilation
• 	Edge fuzziness
• 	Headaches
Why this works
Astigmatism causes light to scatter unevenly across the retina.
• 	Bright white backgrounds scatter too much light → glare
• 	Pure black backgrounds force the pupil to dilate → blur + halation
• 	Soft light backgrounds keep the pupil stable and reduce scatter
This aligns with accessibility guidance that contrast should be high but not extreme, and backgrounds should be light but not glaring.

4. Additional adjustments that help significantly
Brightness matching
Your screen brightness should match the room’s ambient light.
Large mismatches increase strain.
Warm color temperature
Use warmer tones (less blue light), especially in the evening.
This reduces irritation and helps maintain focus.
Increase text size and weight
Larger, heavier fonts reduce the need for micro‑focusing.
Sans‑serif fonts (Segoe UI, Calibri, Inter, Helvetica) are typically clearer.
Avoid ultra‑thin fonts
Thin strokes amplify astigmatic blur.
Use moderate contrast, not maximum contrast
WCAG recommends at least 4.5:1, but you don’t need 21:1 (pure black on pure white).
Softening both sides helps.

5. Practical setup for someone with strong astigmatism (like you)
Since you live in Copenhagen and likely work in mixed natural/artificial light, a balanced setup works well:
Try this combination:
• 	Background: #F7F7F2 (soft off‑white)
• 	Text: #1A1A1A (very dark grey)
• 	Brightness: match the room (avoid max brightness)
• 	Color temperature: warm (Windows Night Light ~30–40%)
• 	Font: Inter / Segoe UI / Calibri at 110–125% scaling
This setup avoids halation, reduces glare, and keeps edges crisp.




Based on the resaerh above use:
This: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension
And this: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/themes#_create-your-own-color-theme 

Remove ALL syntax hilighitng for code, except:
- strings, 
- errors and warnings (both squiggles and other things in the terminal and roaund editor)
- make sure the rest of the editor while monohcrome is accessible and easy to navigate with clear background/foregorund but not as intense as an high-contrast theme 

And make sure you stop only when you have a fully functional vscode theme.
